"""
iGo is a module that lets you create igraphs ("intelligent graphs"). What makes them intelligent is
that their edges have an attribute called itime ("intelligent time"), which takes into account the 
length, the maximum driving speed and the current traffic data of a road, plus the time it takes to
turn depending on the angle and the side of this turn.

The module contains all the functions and data structures needed for acquiring and storing data
(the street network graph and the traffic data), building igraphs, searching ipaths ("intelligent 
paths"), and plotting different information into a map. Moreover, it also contains some utility
functions to convert between geocodable names, nodes, and coordinates. All the coordinates used
by the user of the module should use the Coordinates named tuple, which is in longitude-latitude
order.

    they form given three inodes: predecessor (the source), node (the one both edges have in common)

    to the left or to the right.

    This value is computed using a piecewise function from the angle between the two edges, which is
    first calculated from the edge attribute 'bearing'. This angle goes from -180 to 180 degrees,

    path taking into account the time it takes to turn. In order to do this, the original graph 
    topology is modified. 
    
    The main idea is that, when an edge enters a node and there is more than one exiting edge,
    going to one or another has a certain bearing cost attributed to the physical angle they form.
    To add this cost, each node of the graph is expanded to multiple "inodes" of different type, and 
    new edges are added between them, while the original ones are still maintained. A graph made of
    inodes is called an igraph, which stands for "intelligent graph".

    An igraph has four types of inodes: In, Out, Source, and Destination; and three types of edges:
    real, bearing and path-ends edges.

    One In inode with ID 'I_node_predecessor' is created for every edge entering a node coming from
    a predecessor node. Similarly, one Out inode with ID 'O_node_successor' is created for every
    edge exiting a node to a successor node.

    Furthermore, for every node of the given graph, one Source inode with ID 'S_node' and one
    Destination inode with ID 'D_node' are created. Every path searched in the returned igraph must
    start from a Source inode and end in a Destination inode.

    All the inodes have an attribute named 'metanode' which stores the node ID from the original
    node they come from.

    Real edges are made from the original edges of the graph, which represent the physical streets.
    They go from Out to In inodes, and their their 'itime' and 'length' attributes remain untouched.
    For example, an edge 3 -> 7 from the given graph, would be converted to 'O_3_7' -> 'I_7_3'.
    
    Bearing edges are created from each In inode to every Out inode of a same metanode, forming
    every possible choice of exiting a node once one has entered it. The 'itime' of the bearing
    edges is the cost in seconds of turning from one real edge to another, and it is calculated by
    the bearing_itime function.
    
    Path-ends edges are the ones that connect with the Source and Destination inodes. For each
    metanode, its Source inode is connected to all its Out inodes, and similarly, all its In inodes
    are connected to its Destination inode. The path-ends edges have all itime 0, as they do not
    imply a real cost.

    The Source and Destination inodes exist to avoid adding the bearing cost at the beginning and
    at the end of the path. Because of that, it is not possible to enter a Source inode, nor to exit
    a Destination one.

    The result of doing all this in a small graph can be seen in the following link:
