    to the right.

    This value is computed using a piecewise function depending on the bearing between the two

    """Returns a new graph built from the given one so that it is possible to search for a shortest 
    path taking into account the time it takes to turn. In order to do this, the original graph 
    topology is modified. 
    
    The main idea is that, when an edge enters a node and there is more than one exiting edge, 
    choosing has a certain bearing cost depending on the angle they form. The way in which that 
    is accomplished is by transforming each node of the igraph in multiple iNodes of different type 
    and adding new edges between them while maintaining the original ones.

    The node types are:
     - In nodes: They are of the form I_node_predecessor. A node of this type is created for every 
       original edge comming from a node 'predecessor' that enters to 'node'. 
     - Out node: They are of the form O_node_successor. A node of this type is created for every
       original edge that extis from 'node' to a node 'successor'.
     - Source nodes: There is one for each original node connected with outgoing edges to all the 
       In nodes of it. They are used as an origin to be able to search paths from anywhere without
       an arbitrary bearing decision taken. It is not possible to enter a Source node.
     - Destination nodes: There is one for each original node connected with ingoing edges to all 
       the Out nodes of it. They are used as a destination to be able to search paths to anywhere
       an arbitrary bearing decision taken. It is not possible to exit a Destination node.
    
    The edge types are:
     - Original edges: They go  from an Out node to an In node and are of the form 
       O_predecessor_successor -> I_successor_predecessor. Their 'itime' and 'length' attributes 
       remain untouched. 
     - Bearing edges: A bearing edge is created from each In node to every Out node of a same 
       original node. These are every possible choice of exiting a node once one has entered it and 
       are of the form I_node_predecessor -> I_node_successor. Bearing edges can be thought to be 
       "inside" of what was an old node as a structure that gives the cost in seconds of turning 
       (bearing cost) between two original edges with their only attribute 'itime', which is 
       calculated using the bearing_itime() function of this module.
     - Path-ends edges: These are the edges that connect the Source and Destination nodes to the
       graph and are of the form S_node -> I_node_successor or O_node_predecessor -> D_node. Their
       only attribute 'itime' is 0 seconds.

    In conclusion, the bearing cost of two original edges is the 'itime' of the inner bearing edge 
    that connects two iNodes created from the old node that was common in the two edges.
    
    From now on, the graph is considered intelligent and all its nodes are referred as iNodes.

    The result of doing all this in a simple example can be seen in the following link:
