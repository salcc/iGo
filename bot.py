"""
The iGo Telegram bot shows users in Barcelona the most intelligent way of driving from their current 
location to their desired destination using the concept of itime.

To calculate the itime of a path, several data of Barcelona's road network is taken into account: 
the length and maximum driving speed of each street, the current traffic data available and the cost
of turning. The needed computations are handled by the igo module. 

The bot supports the following commands:
 - /go [destination]: Shows the user a map with the fastest way to go from their current location to
   the specified destination. 
 - /where: Shows the user a map with their current location.
 - /setlang [language code]: Sets the bot's language.
 - /author: Shows who has developed the bot.
 - /help: Shows a list of the available commands and what are they used for.
 - /pos [location]: Changes the user location to the specified one (intended for developement).

The iGo bot is available in different languages. The translations of the shown messages are handled
by the translations module.
