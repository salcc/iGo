I'm iGo, and I'll help you go to wherever you want as quick as a flash.
You can use the command /help to see everything I can do.
Do you want to update your location?
I need to know your location, do you want to share it with me?
So you want to go to 
I'll show you where you are.

I have been developed with ❤️ by Marçal Comajoan Cara and Laura Saéz Parés, two students of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), as a part of a project for the Algorithmics and Programming II subject of the Data Science and Engineering Degree.
/go [destination] - I will show you a map with the fastest way to go from your current location (green marker) to the destination (red marker) that you tell me when you use the command. This path is calculated taking into account the time it takes to turn and the current traffic data of Barcelona.
/where - I will show you a map with your current location indicated with a green marker.
/setlang [language code] - I will talk to you in the language you choose from Catalan [ca], Spanish [es] and English [en].
/author - I will tell you who has developed me.
I'm sorry, there are no results for 
 in Barcelona.
You haven't told me where!
You seem to be outside Barcelona. I'm afraid I can't help you here.
The only way to get where you want is to pass a road that is closed!
